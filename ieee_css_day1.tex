%\section{Expectations}
%If you lose any parts or break anything, please let the TA know and send an email to the instructor with the part number: %\email{pranav.bhounsule@utsa.edu}{pranav.bhounsule@utsa.edu}. 
%\href{mailto:pranav.bhounsule@utsa.edu}{pranav.bhounsule@utsa.edu}.
%This will help us to order for replacement before we give our the LEGO sets next time the course is offered. 
%\\
%\\
%You are supposed to work on the labs individually or in pairs. Each team member is supposed to participate in the programming. The TAs at their discretion might ask any student to explain who a particular task was accomplished and use your performance to evaluate you. %So please work together and contribute to the lab.

\section*{Task 0: Getting ready}
\subsection*{Teaming up}
Team up with your friends into groups of 4 or 5 (4 is ideal). If you are not able to find a group call the TA and she/he will help you. Give your team a name. 
Remember if you have any concerns or issues anytime, please seek the help from the TA and she/he will help you out.

\subsection*{Logging into UTSA machines}
The teaching assistant will provide you with a username and password. This will get you access to the UTSA computer. IMPORTANT: Periodically save you work (lego files) to an email account because your work will get deleted the moment you log off the computer.

\subsection*{Complete the pre-camp survey}
\textcolor{red}{\bf IMPORTANT:}
Please complete this short pre-camp survey. Each student should complete the survey independently.

%\subsection*{(a) Programming basics}
This video shows how to write a basic program that plays a sound using the brick.
\\
Video: 
\bluehref{https://youtu.be/81hctQt6Cp8}{https://youtu.be/81hctQt6Cp8} (Duration: 4 min 29 sec) \\
 \textcolor{magenta}{\bf Task 2: Follow the video and show your work to the teaching assistant.}

\section*{Task 5: Car racing}
\subsection*{Reacting to sensor measurements}
The next task is a race that will be played by all teams together as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:car_racing}. The goal is to program your car to move from start to end as shown. The moment the TA says ``Go" you will press a button on the brick initiating your car to move in a straight line towards the a red line as shown. The car which comes to a complete stop on the red line (color sensor on the car should be above the red line) first will be declared a winner.

%\end{enumerate}

%\clearpage
%\section*{Task 3: Color Sensor}
%To get credit, you will need to demonstrate the following things to the teaching assistant. 


%HINT: Do not dis-assemble your car. You will be able to reuse the car in the next lab.

%\section{Competition}
%There is no competition planned for this lab. Future labs will have a competition between teams.


%\subsection{Basic Soldering}
%Watch this youtube video first: \bluehref{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLfXXRfRIzY}{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLfXXRfRIzY}. \\
%Now solder two pieces of wire as shown towards the end of the video. Each person in the group should do this exercise and show it to the teaching assistant
%%%%%

%\subsection{Peer-Review}
%IMPORTANT: Ask the Lab Assistant to do a peer-review for effort before leaving the lab. It is your duty to remind the teaching assistant. Else, nobody will get credit for that particular lab.
