Additional printouts to go with lab.

- All docs (except except lego_trajectory2.pdf): open with adobe reader and color printer on letter size


- Open lego_trajectory2.pdf with adobe reader. Then say print -> Poster -> color print.
This will print the trajectory on 12 letter size pages. These pages will need to be manually assembled and stuck together using tape to create the trajectory. The file may be edited using adobe illustrator.
